  TI AM26x pinctrl node.

  Pins can be configured using following macro:
    TI_AM26X_PINMUX(gpio_num, value)

  - Pass gpio_num using macro: PIN_GPIO(gpio_num).
    Example: if you want to configure GPIO0,
      use macro as PIN_GPIO(0)

  - value is a 32-bit number that will be written to IOMUX register
    in TI_AM26X_PINMUX macro, pass value as an ORed list of following macros:

      > Choose pin's MUX mode by using following macro: PIN_MODE(num)
        The exact MUX mode can be determined by reading TRM

      > To override default PINMUX configuration and forcibly
        enable/disable input/output , use following macros:
          PIN_FORCE_INPUT_ENABLE  to forcibly enable input
          PIN_FORCE_INPUT_DISABLE to forcibly disable input
          PIN_FORCE_OUTPUT_ENABLE to forcibly enable output
          PIN_FORCE_OUTPUT_DISABLE to forcibly disable output

      > Enable/disable pull selection by following macros:
        PIN_PULL_ENABLE or PIN_PULL_DISABLE
        Set pull to up / down by using:
        PIN_PULL_UP or PIN_PULL_DOWN

      > Set slew rate to high / low by using :
        PIN_SLEW_RATE_HIGH or PIN_SLEW_RATE_LOW

      > Set GPIO - CPU ownership by using following macros:
        PIN_GPIO_R5SS0_0 to allow cluster0, CPU0 to get control
        PIN_GPIO_R5SS0_1 to allow cluster0, CPU1 to get control

      > Choose input qualifier type by following macros:
        PIN_QUAL_SYNC for sync input
        PIN_QUAL_3SAMPLE for a qual of 3 samples
        PIN_QUAL_6SAMPLE for a qual of 6 samples
        PIN_QUAL_ASYNC for async input

      > To choose whether input to pad must be inverted or not:
        PIN_INVERT to invert input
        PIN_NON_INVERT to NOT invert input (default)

  Example: To configure UART Tx pin, macro is used as follows:
    TI_AM26X_PINMUX(PIN_GPIO(28),
      (PIN_MODE(0) | PIN_PULL_DISABLE | PIN_SLEW_RATE_LOW))
    Above macro means GPIO 28 is configured as follows:
      - MUX Mode 0
      - PULL selection is disabled
      - Slew rate is low
