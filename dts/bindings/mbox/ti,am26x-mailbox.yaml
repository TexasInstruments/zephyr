  TI AM26x Family Mailbox Controller
  This driver is compatible with the IPC notify V1 from TI's MCU_PLUS_SDK.
  The Client ID in the message is not used in this implementation. Hence,
  the application needs to take care of such message encoding/decoding if
  required.

compatible: "ti,am26x-mailbox"

include: [base.yaml, mailbox-controller.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Register space for the mailbox controller.
      Should include two entries: MSS controller registers and mailbox SRAM.

  reg-names:
    required: true
    type: string-array
    description: |
      Names corresponding to the register areas.
      Should be "ctrl" for MSS controller registers and "mbox-ram" for mailbox SRAM.

  core-id:
    required: true
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    description: |
      Identifier for the core this instance is running on.
      The value corresponds to the core ID within the SoC.
      For example, in AM261x:
      0 = R5FSS0_0
      1 = R5FSS0_1

      In other AM26x family SoCs with more cores, this would map to their 
      respective core IDs based on the SoC's core numbering scheme.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: |
      Interrupt specifier for the mailbox interrupt.
      
mbox-cells:
  - channel
